Hey there â€” Iâ€™m Aleksey Skorobogaty, a systems architect with 12+ years in software engineering and 5+ years leading technical teams. I love designing cloud-native systems from the first principles[^1] that teams can operate with confidence.

### What I Bring
 - Technical Leadership & Strategy
 - Learning Organization & Cumulative Culture
 - Distributed Systems & Microservices
 - Message-Driven & Event-Driven Architectures
 - Domain-Driven Design & Data Mesh Expertise
 - Resilience, Scalability, High-Availability
 - Advanced Concurrent Golang Programming
 - Pioneering Agentic AI & Context Engineering

#### Hereâ€™s how we can work together

1. Need resilient systems? Gotta get it right![^2]

    Hire me to design and lead the development of reliable, scalable distributed systems that secure long-term product growth â€“ [CV page](/cv/).

2. Looking to future-proof your engineering org?

    Strategy is a series of meaningful decisions. Iâ€™d be excited to partner with teams to craft and execute an Engineering Strategy that lays the groundwork for seamless team cooperation in one medium with Agentic AI.

3. Building (or already running) a platform?

    Systems and people are intertwined. Product people understand this. We design feedback loops. We create structures that shape behavior![^3]
    
    Iâ€™d love to step in as a Platform Product Manager for building platform structures â€” shaping high-performance autonomous teams and aligning vision with the reality of Agentic AI.

#### My Current Focus

For the past five years, Iâ€™ve been obsessed with one question: How do we unlock true autonomy for teams building reliable systems?

Last year, I built conceptual integrity around my experience and began R&D work to craft Endurance â€” cognitive scaffolding for understanding cause and effect in complex systems.

Addresed questions so far:

- Human + AI collective agency
- Psychological safety in agent-augmented teams
- Knowledge flow at scale
- Scope economics and decision-making under uncertainty
